My first deep dive in using react. I built this from scratch using HTML, SCSS and React. This taught me many aspects of building for the web. I used the syntax for function components. I learned how to implement React-Router. I used the rest API to pull Vimeo Videos and populate cards using javascript and json. I converted this design from a Figma file to build a responsive website.
